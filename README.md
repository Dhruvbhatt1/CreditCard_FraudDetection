# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive approach to detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. By analyzing transaction data, the project identifies patterns and anomalies to accurately classify legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant issue in today's digital economy, where millions of transactions occur daily. The goal of this project is to develop a reliable and efficient fraud detection model that minimizes false positives while maximizing the detection of fraudulent transactions.

This project uses a dataset containing credit card transaction details and applies machine learning algorithms to address challenges such as imbalanced data, high dimensionality, and real-time detection requirements.

## üìÇ Key Features

- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Gain insights into transaction data distribution and detect hidden patterns indicative of fraud.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Use techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and class-weight adjustments to address class imbalance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate models using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to balance detection accuracy with false positive rates.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), containing anonymized credit card transaction data for confidentiality. The data includes:

- **Features**: Numerical attributes derived from PCA transformation
- **Target**: Binary variable indicating legitimate (`0`) or fraudulent (`1`) transactions

## üîç Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing and duplicate values
   - Normalize and scale numerical features
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize class distributions
   - Investigate correlations between features
3. **Model Development**:
   - Train multiple classifiers
   - Optimize hyperparameters using Grid Search and Cross Validation
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Analyze precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC
   - Address trade-offs between precision and recall
5. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - Plan for real-time fraud detection scenarios
   - Discuss monitoring and updating the model post-deployment
